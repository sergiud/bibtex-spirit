%%%                        because of a restriction in the current

%%%                        A search of MathSciNet in mid-December 1995
%%%                        turned up 258 bibliographic references to
%%%                        Maple.  After laborious manual conversion
%%%                        to BibTeX form, correction of errors,
%%%                        addition of missing data, elimination of
%%%                        authors named Maple, and elimination of
%%%                        entries already present in this file, this
%%%                        work resulted in the addition of 139 new
%%%                        entries, bringing the total number of
%%%                        entries to 267.  Cross-checking of
%%%                        libraries and publishers turned up another
%%%                        25, pushing the total to 292 at version
%%%                        2.22.  Because the word Maple often does
%%%                        not occur in the title in these new
%%%                        entries, I have added a keywords field to
%%%                        include that information.
%%%
%%%                        At version 2.26 [05-Feb-1996], a search of
%%%                        the OCLC Article1st database resulted in
%%%                        the addition of 40 new references (out
%%%                        of a total of 632 articles, most about
%%%                        maple (forests, sugar, syrup, trees, wood,
%%%                        ...)), and updating of another 9.
%%%
%%%                        Regrettably, the OCLC database does not
%%%                        usually record final page numbers of
%%%                        journal articles, so there are many page
%%%                        ranges of the form 123--?? in this
%%%                        bibliography.

%%%                        At version 2.31 [12-Apr-1996], searches of

%%%                        PapersFirst, and Proceedings databases, and
%%%                        the Uncover database, produced 79 new
%%%                        entries.
%%%
%%%                        At version 2.44 [18-Dec-1996], searches of
%%%                        the Compendex databases (1970--1996) added
%%%                        27 new entries, and updated 18 others.

%%%                        The checksum field above contains a CRC-16
%%%                        checksum as the first value, followed by the
%%%                        equivalent of the standard UNIX wc (word
%%%                        count) utility output of lines, words, and
%%%                        characters.  This is produced by Robert

                 higher complexity than have been attempted in the past.
                 We have employed that algorithm in a symbolic rather
                 than a numerical setting using MAPLE a relatively new
                 symbolic mathematical processor which has been
                 implemented on both VAX and IBM systems. The first
                 result of this program's execution was an expression
                 for `energy' of the form energy ( sigma, b). This
                 energy was then minimized. Although MAPLE can integrate
                 many functions, it can not integrate all functions.
                 Specifically, MAPLE was unable to handle wave functions
                 which contained logarithmic (Fock type) terms.",

                 algorithm implementors. However, for many problems, the
                 choice of a system makes much less difference that the
                 approach used to represent the problem. The mapping
                 from mathematics to a data representation and the
                 choice of algorithms can make significant, and
                 separate, contributions to efficiency. Systems which
                 have the flexibility to provide several data structures
                 and algorithms can provide an advantage in this
                 respect. Macsyma is probably the system with the
                 largest selection. On the other hand, Macsyma has not
                 taken advantage of recent advances such as the
                 extensive use of hash-coding incorporated in the
                 University of Waterloo's Maple system. For the one
                 somewhat artificial benchmark discussed, it appears
                 that the Maple system does considerably better than any
                 representation in Macsyma by precisely this
                 mechanism.",

                 motion problem. Given n point matches between two
                 frames, an effort is made to determine the number of
                 solution to the motion problem. It is shown that the
                 maximum number of solutions is ten when five-point
                 matches are available. Two approaches are used. The
                 first attempts to recover the motion parameters by
                 studying the essential matrix. A natural extension of
                 this is to use algebraic geometry to characterize the
                 set of possible essential matrixes. The authors present
                 some results based on this approach. The second one,
                 based on projective geometry, dates from the previous
                 century. The authors show that the two approaches are
                 compatible and yield the same result. They then
                 describe a computer implementation of the second
                 approach that uses MAPLE, a language for symbolic
                 computation. The program allows the exact computation
                 of the solutions for any configuration of five

                 produces a differential equation satisfied by
                 A(x):=/sub - infinity / integral /sup infinity
                 /F(x,y)dy. A function F(x,y) is hyperexponential if
                 both F/sub x/(x,y)/F(x,y) and F/sub y/(x,y)/F(x,y) are
                 rational functions of (x,y). A(x) always satisfies a
                 linear differential equation with polynomial
                 coefficients. The authors give a MAPLE program that
                 implements that algorithm. The same algorithm, and

                 three is in the Numerical Algorithms Group (Fortran
                 77). SENAC is a package developed by the Mathematical
                 Software Project at the University of Waikato. SENAC
                 includes a symbolic manipulation interpreter (Sencore),
                 together with high level interfaces to the NAG Fortran
                 Library (Numlink) and NAG Graphics Library (Graflink).
                 The system evolved from an interface, Naglink, between
                 the NAG Library and the symbolic manipulation language
                 Macsyma. The Sensore interpreter is written in Common
                 LISP and belongs to the Macsyma/Maple/Reduce family of
                 languages. It is easy to load user-written files
                 written in Common LISP or in SENAC. InterCall is a
                 Mathematica package that enables its user to
                 interactively call external code, for example from an
                 external numeric library. It allows various default
                 settings to be defined for any arguments that need to
                 be passed to any routine in that code, and initial
                 default settings for all the routines in the IMSL and
                 NAG libraries are included with InterCall in the form
                 of a small defaults-database file. IRENA-an Interface
                 from Reduce to NAG-runs under the Reduce computer
                 algebra system and provides an interactive front end to
                 the NAG Library. It has been designed to make the use

                 by hand, symbolic algebra programs are used. To access
                 the usefulness of these programs and to solve some
                 design problems, a MAPLE procedure, ZERODYN, is written
                 to calculate the zero dynamics symbolically. The
                 procedure can, however, not solve all problems, mainly
                 because general symbolic algebra programs have
                 insufficient capabilities to solve sets of nonlinear
                 equations and partial differential equations. A

  abstract =     "Symbolic computation has been applied in many
                 scientific disciplines and has proved to be a very
                 valuable research tool. In earlier studies, features of
                 symbolic computation including algebraic manipulations
                 and high decimal precision, were shown to be very
                 useful to solve nonrelativistic quantum mechanical
                 problems. The author illustrates the valuable
                 assistance of symbolic computation in solving quantum
                 chemical problems. The symbolic computational language
                 MAPLE is used throughout this study. The computational
                 aspects of the application of L{\"o}wdin's Optimized
                 Inner Projection (OIP) to determine lower bounds to the
                 ground state energy of the Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP)
                 model of cyclic polyenes, is briefly presented. A
                 diagrammatic approach for evaluating the required
                 matrix elements is needed: this method is often used in
                 quantum chemistry. The evaluation of Brandow diagrams,
                 which is very tedious and almost impossible to do by
                 hand, is easily obtained using MAPLE.",

  abstract =     "We give an overview of the hybrid symbolic-numeric
                 integrator in MAPLE. The approach used is to recognize
                 the presence of singularities and, when possible, to
                 transform the problem to avoid the singularity. At the
                 base of the hybrid method are numerical integration
                 techniques. We have found that for integrands which are
                 analytic in a 'sufficiently large' region of the
                 complex plane surrounding the interval of integration,
                 the method of choice is Clenshaw--Curtis quadrature. An
                 added advantage of this method is that it can be
                 programmed to detect cases where the Chebyshev series
                 coefficients converge slowly (or diverge), and to give
                 up quickly in such cases. The singularity handling
                 techniques can then be applied. There is a need for a
                 numerical method other than Clenshaw--Curtis
                 quadrature, a method which can deal with end-point
                 singularities and singularities lying 'nearby' in the
                 complex plane. We have found that the
                 double-exponential method performs very well in the
                 presence of several types of singularities, and its
                 performance does not degrade when arbitrarily high
                 precision is demanded. The combination of
                 Clenshaw--Curtis quadrature and the double exponential
                 method support the numerical computation phase which,
                 along with the symbolic analysis techniques for
                 singularity handling, define an automated approach to
                 the symbolic-numeric computation of definite integrals

                 mechanical transmission systems is given. The method is
                 adapted for computer-aided analysis and synthesis of
                 the kinematics, loads and power flows. Losses are
                 included. All relationships are handled by a computer
                 program. No manual formulation and elimination of
                 equations are necessary. The user only needs to
                 describe the transmission system: 1. The transmission
                 units, e.g. gear transmissions, planetary gear trains,
                 clutches, input and output shafts. 2. How the shafts of
                 those units are connected. Then, the computer program
                 formulates and arranges the relationships. After that,
                 a commercial program, ``Maple'', performs the algebraic
                 eliminations. Relationships between the speeds
                 and\slash or torques of two arbitrary shafts can be
                 derived, e.g. an algebraic relationship for the overall
                 efficiency. Different power flows are possible in
                 split-power transmissions. Special algorithms handle
                 that. The method is a useful tool. It saves time and
                 eliminates the risk for human errors.",

                 frequently appear in a variety of elasticity problems
                 and, most often, in crack problems. Here we extend the
                 classical direct numerical methods for the approximate
                 solution of these equations to the
                 semi-analytical\slash numerical (SAN) environment
                 offered by modern computer algebra systems (CAS). The
                 idea is simply to use Taylor-Maclaurin series in the
                 approximate SAN solution and to reduce the problem to a
                 purely numerical set of systems of linear equations.
                 The approach is illustrated in the classical
                 Lobatto-Chebyshev method with an application to the
                 problem of a periodic array of collinear cracks.
                 Extensive displayed SAN results for the stress
                 intensity factors show the convergence and efficiency
                 of the proposed SAN approach. The cases of other direct

                 complement for numerical tools, and as a substitute for
                 analytical (paper and pencil) work. The symbolic
                 computation program MAPLE is used as a computing
                 substrate for NONqqCON. To assess the viability of this
                 tool, several algorithms available for analysis and
                 design are implemented in NONqqCON, and applied to
                 examples of textbook problems with published solutions
                 and also to a larger scale problem. The examples in the
                 paper address the following symbolic computational
                 areas for nonlinear dynamic systems: (1) the normal
                 form, (2) the zero dynamics, (3) the input-output exact
                 linearizing state-feedback, (4) the state space exact
                 linearizing state-feedback, including the search for
                 output functions that give the system a full or maximal
                 order relative degree. The systems are not required to
                 have a well defined relative degree. The textbook
                 problems show that the NONqqCON package can be
                 successfully used. The larger scale problem is,
                 however, too complex to be solved with the current
                 versions of NONqqCON and MAPLE. Some recommendations to
                 improve the implementation and to make MAPLE more
                 suitable for use with NONqqCON are given. The
                 conclusion is that symbolic computation is a viable
                 approach for straightforward textbook problems, but not
                 grown up enough to tackle larger problems. However, we
                 envision substantial future progress.",

                 recursive and algorithmic, and we describe a program

                 whose domains of validity are unnecessarily restricted
                 by the presence of discontinuities. It is argued that
                 this is undesirable and that integration routines
                 should meet an additional requirement: they should
                 return expressions that are valid on domains of maximum
                 extent. The contention is supported by general
                 mathematical arguments, by an examination of existing
                 practises and by a demonstration that two standard
                 algorithms can be modified to meet the requirement.",

                 the derivatives of a function $f:R^n$ to $R^m$ as well
                 as the function values of $f$ itself. All computer
                 algebra systems can differentiate functions represented
                 by formulae. But not all functions can be described by
                 formulae. And formulae are not always the most
                 effective means for representing functions and
                 derivatives. In this paper we describe the algorithms
                 used by the Maple (2) routine GRADIENT that accepts as
                 input a Maple procedure for the computation of $f$ and
                 outputs a new Maple procedure that computes the
                 gradient of $f$. The design of the GRADIENT routine is
                 such that it is also trivial to generate Maple

  abstract =     "$\parallel$Maple$\parallel$ (speak: parallel Maple) is
                 a portable system for parallel symbolic computation.
                 The system is built as an interface between the
                 parallel declarative programming language Strand and
                 the sequential computer algebra system Maple, thus
                 providing the elegance of Strand and the power of the
                 existing sequential algorithms in Maple. The
                 implementation of different parallel programming
                 paradigms shows that it is fairly easy to parallelize
                 even complex algebraic algorithms using this system.
                 Sample applications (among them algorithms solving
                 multivariate nonlinear equation systems) are
                 implemented on various parallel architectures. For
                 example a straightforward parallelization of the
                 complex and important problem of real root isolation
                 has been parallelized using a generic Strand program of
                 fewer than 20 lines of code and a slight modification
                 of 5 lines in the original sequential Maple source.
                 Even with such a simple modification we gained a
                 speed-up of 5 times, that is better than those reported
                 by others in the literature.",

  abstract =     "The software engineering of Neural Network (NN)
                 applications faces many different problems from those
                 of traditional programming. Due to the stochastic
                 nature of NN, it is extremely hard to verify the
                 correctness of a NN application by exhaustive testing.
                 It is also very hard to tell whether a NN application
                 is generating the intended results, because there are
                 many parameters and variables. Lastly, NN software is
                 usually time intensive and highly optimised code is
                 required. This paper explores the use of computer
                 algebra to synthesize neural network applications. We
                 can generate highly reliable and efficient codes
                 (probably the most efficient possible) from a high
                 level NN algebraic specification. The computer algebra
                 package not only handles most of the algebraic
                 manipulation in the deviation of the computation
                 formulas, but also perform simplification and
                 verification. Due to the non-existence of control
                 codes, synthesized NN codes can fully exploit computer
                 architecture such as high-speed cache and pipelines.",

  abstract =     "Many chemical reaction systems studied in the
                 pharmaceutical industry have phenomena that occur on
                 two or more vastly different time scales. When modeling
                 the chemical reaction system as ordinary differential
                 equations, if a small parameter $E$ can be identified
                 then one can isolate the behavior of the system on long
                 and short time scales using singular perturbation
                 theory. In practice, the small parameter is discovered
                 using knowledge about the chemical reaction system that
                 is not necessarily contained in the mathematics of the
                 model. If a small parameter cannot be easily
                 identified, then the approach is typically abandoned.
                 The authors present a procedure that derives algebraic
                 expressions for dual time scales in mathematical models
                 of chemical reaction systems. Unlike conventional
                 practice, this derivation proceeds using only
                 information contained in the model, without knowledge
                 of a small parameter derived through external
                 considerations. The authors' procedure, Scales, is
                 based on rules that arise from the `art and practice'
                 of applying the quasi-steady-state assumption to derive
                 the Michaelis-Menton equations. The authors depart from
                 standard practice of singular perturbation theory,
                 using instead the viewpoint of Segel and Slemrod
                 (1989). They have implemented Scales in Maple. Scales
                 is closer to an `expert system' than a `scale oracle'
                 or decision procedure. Its shortcomings necessitate
                 subsequent verification of its results, typically
                 through numerical or laboratory experimentation. If
                 validated, additional computer algebra techniques can
                 be used to simplify the mathematical model and isolate
                 the long time scale behavior.",

                 other tools for scientific computation, into a single
                 distributed problem-solving environment. MP is layered,
                 reflecting the logically distinct aspects of tool
                 integration. Data representation issues are addressed
                 by specifying a set of basic data types and a mechanism
                 for constructing non-basic types. MP passes all data in
                 the form of annotated parse trees. The parse tree
                 provides a simple, flexible and tool-independent way to
                 represent and exchange data, and annotations provide a
                 powerful and generic expressive facility for
                 transmitting additional information. MP also provides
                 efficient encodings for numeric data and includes
                 different types of optimizations to reduce the cost of
                 exchanging data. The optimizations are important when
                 transmitting large expressions typically encountered in
                 symbolic and numeric computation. MP is extensible.
                 Users can define additional sets of operators and
                 annotations as well as tailor the generic optimization
                 mechanisms to efficiently encode their own data
                 structures. A clear distinction between MP-defined and
                 user-defined definitions is enforced.",

                 techniques leads to new approaches for problem-solving
                 in areas of applied mathematics and science. It is
                 shown, in examples from Physical Chemistry and
                 Biochemistry, how the use of a modern computer algebra
                 system such as Maple enables an automatic and
                 computerized solution of problems in ways that are not
                 possible with conventional computing systems. In our
                 first example we study the thermodynamic behavior of
                 steam reforming reactions and determine the temperature
                 and pressure dependence of the chemical compositions at
                 equilibrium. Using Maple's symbolic computation
                 capabilities a system of nonlinear equations for the
                 reaction extents is derived. For the fast numerical
                 solution of the nonlinear equations the Newton--Raphson
                 algorithm is applied. A FORTRAN preprocessor in Maple
                 calculates the Jacobian matrix needed for this
                 algorithm and generates a complete and ready-to-compile
                 FORTRAN program. In the second example we demonstrate
                 how the McConnell equations in Biochemistry, a linear
                 inhomogeneous system of differential equations with
                 constant coefficients, can be solved analytically in a
                 direct way by using Maple's symbolic linear algebra
                 routines. In addition, the automatic generation of
                 numerical code for the determination of the formal
                 parameters involved in the solutions is described.",

                 require the computation of Jacobian matrices. This
                 being particularly true for implicit integration
                 algorithms, and not for explicit ones. These
                 computations often take a significant proportion of the
                 overall CPU time. This paper presents an application of
                 the automatic differentiation method which results in
                 large savings in the computation of Jacobian matrices.
                 An original application of this method is in a software
                 which simulates power systems dynamics. As the program
                 enables the users to introduce their own models,
                 automatic differentiation becomes particularly
                 efficient. In comparison with numerical
                 differentiation, it leads to a saving of 80\% of the
                 time required for the computation of the Jacobian
                 matrices and up to 28\% of the total CPU time.
                 Automatic differentiation is a very efficient method
                 which should be valuable to other power system

                 achieved only by utilizing advanced control algorithms.
                 However, precise control of robot motion requires the
                 use of accurate dynamic models, which are very
                 complicated due to varying arm geometric configuration,
                 uncertain effects of load handling on the dynamic
                 stability of the arm, and the high degree of
                 nonlinearity and coupling exhibited between different
                 links. Therefore, an efficient and fast method for
                 on-line tuning of robot dynamic parameters must be
                 devised. In this work a simplified model based on
                 Lagrange--Euler dynamics is developed. The proposed
                 method is simple and systematic for the extraction and
                 identification of robot dynamic parameters. The dynamic
                 parameters are then formulated as a regression model.
                 This model is used to generate the closed-form solution
                 of the dynamics. The analysis in this work is based on
                 a set of compiled data for the Stanford arm to
                 facilitate the study of the dynamic performance and
                 closed-loop solutions of robot manipulators. For the

                 separated-form formulation of dynamic equations of
                 multibody systems subject to control. The algorithm is
                 derived from the virtual work principle and includes
                 the moving base effects. The elastic members are
                 treated as Euler--Bernoulli beams. Equations of motion
                 are expanded using generalized coordinate partitioning
                 and a Jacobian matrix expansion. The formulation of
                 each physical term is separated, i.e., the inertia
                 matrix, nonlinear coupling vector, generalized force
                 vector and base motion-induced terms are established
                 individually. The formulation is implemented on a
                 workstation using MAPLE. Nonlinear and linearized
                 equations with control are generated in FORTRAN format.
                 The control design adopts second-order models directly.
                 Several examples including a spin-up cantilever beam,
                 an elastic vehicle with active suspensions and an
                 elastic slider-crank mechanism are given. Numerical
                 results for nonlinear and linear spin-up beam models

                 Geometry (CSG) systems in MAPLE V. It has successfully
                 processed CSG figures containing 64 primitives. This
                 work involved over 2000 lines of MAPLE code. The system
                 will take objects represented both parametrically (to
                 allow changes) and numerically (to provide
                 constraints). Constraints are automatically generated
                 to ensure that as the user changes parameters, the
                 object remains conceptually the same. There are many
                 companies building parametric CAD systems for
                 mechanical engineers. In these systems, the user can
                 associate variables with particular dimensions of the
                 object. Then, different objects from a given ``family
                 of parts'' could be generated by simply giving new
                 values to these parameters. For example, we might have
                 the following figure which represents a plate with a
                 slot. As A and B vary, the slot width changes and the
                 location changes. However, if A and B';s changes are
                 sufficient in magnitude, the object is no longer a slot
                 with a hole in it. This example comes from a paper on
                 parametric CSG (Gossard 88). See Figure 1. Our system
                 would generate inequalities involving these parameters.
                 As long as these inequalities are satisfied, situations
                 such as those shown by Figure 1 would be prevented. The
                 situation is even more important in shape optimization
                 (Botkin 82). In this paper, the inequality constraints
                 are referred to as side conditions. He developed a
                 custom technique to generate these side conditions. Our
                 system generates them for an arbitrary object defined
                 by CSG. To our knowledge, this is the first report of
                 generating these side conditions automatically from a
                 CSG model. Shape optimization is the combination of a
                 mathematical programming code with finite element
                 analysis (Hafka 86). The parameters are varied, with an
                 objective such as minimizing the total weight of the
                 object. The finite element analysis ensures, for each
                 set of parameters, that the object will withstand the
                 stresses from the applied loads. A mathematical
                 programming code would also need a subroutine that
                 would generate the constraints, i.e., to determine
                 whether the values chosen are permissible, i.e., meet
                 all physical and other requirements. In shape
                 optimization, these would include the geometric
                 constraints (Kirsch 81). Our MAPLE program
                 automatically generates the constraints for this
                 purpose. Several articles explored the possibility of
                 representing dimensions and tolerances using symbolic
                 connectors called stiffeners. They include (Hillyard,
                 78), (Lin, 81) and (Gopin, 79). A discussion of these
                 issues, with particular emphasis on the issue of
                 tolerancing, can be found in (Requicha, 84). He stated
                 that, `lists of desirable properties for variational
                 classes are unknown [and] the algorithmic indications
                 of various approaches are not understood.' We hope this
                 software is a contribution towards resolving these
                 issues.",

                 algebraic function field are implemented in some
                 computer algebra systems. They are used e.g. for the
                 integration of algebraic functions. The method used by
                 Maple 5.2 and AXIOM is given by B. M. Trager (1984). He
                 adapted an algorithm of Ford and Zassenhaus (1978),
                 that computes the ring of integers in an algebraic
                 number field, to the case of a function field. It turns
                 out that using algebraic geometry one can write a
                 faster algorithm. The method we give is based on
                 Puiseux expansions. One can see this as a variant on
                 the Coates' algorithm as it is described by Davenport
                 (1981). Some difficulties in computing with Puiseux
                 expansions can be avoided using a sharp bound for the
                 number of terms required which are given. We derive
                 which denominator is needed in the integral basis.
                 Using this result `intermediate expression swell' can
                 be avoided. The Puiseux expansions generally introduce
                 algebraic extensions.",

  abstract =     "It is important to know whether a linear system of
                 differential equations has a regular or an irregular
                 singularity at a given point $x_0$ of the complex
                 domain C. Moser (1960) has given an algorithm to solve
                 this problem. His algorithm needs to compute with the
                 individual singularities of the system and requires
                 computations in algebraic extensions of the constant
                 field for the coefficients of the system. This may
                 represent an important drawback from a practical point
                 of view. This paper describes a rational version of
                 Moser's algorithm which has been implemented in the
                 Maple computer algebra system for systems of
                 differential equations with coefficients in $Q(x)$. It
                 never needs to compute with the individual
                 singularities of the system and avoids any algebraic
                 extensions. In addition, our algorithm reduces a linear
                 system of differential equations with coefficients in
                 $Q(x)$ to an `irreducible' form which is particularly
                 convenient if one wishes to compute invariants at
                 singularities.",

                 polynomial is a function that takes as input a value
                 for each variable and then produces the value of the
                 polynomial. We revisit the problem of computing the
                 greatest common divisor (GCD) in black box format of
                 several multivariate polynomials that themselves are
                 given by black boxes. To this end an improved version
                 of the algorithm sketched by E. Kaltofen and B. Trager
                 (1990) is described. Also the full analysis of the
                 improved algorithm is given. Our algorithm constructs
                 in random polynomial-time a procedure that will
                 evaluate a fixed associate of the GCD at an arbitrary
                 point (supplied as its input) in polynomial time. The
                 randomization of the black box construction is of the

  abstract =     "In almost all analyses of the least-mean-square (LMS)
                 adaptive filter, it is assumed that the filter
                 coefficients are statistically independent of the input
                 data currently in filter memory, an assumption that is
                 incorrect for shift-input data. In this paper, we
                 present a method for deriving a set of linear update
                 equations that can be used to predict the exact
                 statistical behavior of a finite-impulse-response (FIR)
                 LMS adaptive filter operating upon finite-time
                 correlated input data. Using our method, we can derive
                 exact bounds upon the LMS step size to guarantee mean
                 and mean-square convergence. Our equation-deriving
                 procedure is recursive and algorithmic, and we describe
                 a program written in the MAPLE symbolic-manipulation
                 software package that automates-the derivation for
                 arbitrarily-long adaptive filters operating on input
                 data with stationary statistics. Using our analysis, we
                 present a search algorithm that determines the exact
                 step size mean-square stability bound for a given
                 filter length and input correlation statistics.
                 Extensive computer simulations indicate that the exact
                 analysis is more accurate than previous analyses in
                 predicting adaptation behavior. Our results also
                 indicate that the exact step size bound is much more
                 stringent than the bound predicted by the independence
                 assumption analysis for correlated input data.",

  abstract =     "The heuristic polynomial GCD procedure (GCDHEU) is
                 used by the Maple computer algebra system, but no
                 other. Because Maple has an especially efficient kernel
                 that provides fast integer arithmetic, but a relatively
                 slower interpreter for non-kernel code, the GCDHEU
                 routine is especially effective in that it moves much
                 of the computation into `bignum' arithmetic and hence
                 executes primarily in the kernel. We speculated that in
                 other computer algebra systems an implementation of
                 GCDHEU would not be advantageous. In particular, if all
                 the system code is compiled to run at `full speed' in a
                 (presumably more bulky) kernel that is entirely written
                 in C or compiled Lisp, then there would seem to be no
                 point in recasting the polynomial GCD problem into a
                 bignum GCD problem. Manipulating polynomials that are
                 vectors of coefficients would seem to be equivalent
                 computationally to manipulating vectors of big digits.
                 Yet our evidence suggests that one can take advantage
                 of the GCDHEU in a Lisp system as well. Given a good
                 implementation of bignums, for most small problems and
                 many large ones, a substantial speedup can be obtained
                 by the appropriate choice of GCD algorithm, including
                 often enough, the GCDHEU approach. Another major winner
                 seem to be the subresultant polynomial remainder
                 sequence algorithm. Because more sophisticated sparse
                 algorithms are relatively slow on small problems and
                 only occasionally emerge as superior (on larger
                 problems) it seems the choice of a fast GCD algorithm
                 is tricky.",

  abstract =     "We describe a method which uses a finite number of
                 differentiations and linear operations to determine the
                 Cartan structure coefficients of a structurally
                 transitive Lie pseudogroup from its infinitesimal
                 defining equations. If the defining system is of first
                 order and the pseudogroup has no scalar invariants, the
                 structure coefficients can be simply extracted from the
                 coefficients of the infinitesimal system. We give an
                 algorithm which reduces the higher order case to the
                 first order case. The reduction process uses only
                 differentiation and linear eliminations, for which
                 several well-known algorithms are available. Our method
                 makes feasible the calculation of the Cartan structure
                 of infinite Lie pseudogroups of symmetries of
                 differential equations. Examples including the KP

  abstract =     "J. Kovacic (J. Symb. Comp., vol. 2, pp. 3-43, 1986)
                 gave an algorithm for solving second-order linear
                 homogeneous differential equations. This algorithm,
                 known as the Kovacic algorithm, computes the
                 Liouvillian solutions of L(y)=y'-ry=0 (with r in C(x)).
                 Since exponential solutions of linear differential
                 equations are in general more difficult to compute than
                 rational solutions, we propose an algorithm where
                 rational solutions of symmetric powers are used as much
                 as possible instead of exponential solutions. The
                 advantage of our approach is (1) to give a simple proof
                 of a Kovacic-like algorithm for arbitrary coefficient
                 fields and to give a complete overview of all the
                 possible polynomials; (2) to provide an
                 easy-to-implement algorithm using only rational
                 solutions for completely reducible groups G(L)
                 contained in SL(2,C); and (3) to avoid algebraic
                 extensions of the constant field by using rational
                 solutions instead of exponential solutions of symmetric
                 powers. The algorithm as been implemented in the Maple
                 system and should soon find its way into the Maple
                 share library. The new version is always faster than
                 the current Maple implementation of the Kovacic
                 algorithm, especially for example where G(L) is a
                 finite primitive subgroup of SL(2,C) and where the
                 current implementation fails to answer in most cases.",

                 operates under the Windows operating system. At the
                 present time, Splice is the only commercially available
                 software that will perform this type of analysis. A
                 description of the features found in Splice 1.0 and
                 examples to illustrate them is presented. Splice works
                 with The Design Center circuit simulator available from
                 the MicroSim Corporation. The user adds special
                 `analysis symbols' to the circuit schematic that
                 instruct Splice to perform a specific type of analysis.
                 The analysis symbols are transparent to PSpice, giving
                 the user the option to simulate the network at any
                 time. Splice is powered internally by the Waterloo
                 Maple Software algebraic engine and will analyze many
                 types of linear and linearized electrical networks
                 consisting of inductors (with initial conditions),
                 capacitors (with initial conditions), resistors,
                 transformers, transistors (bipolar and field-effect),
                 operational amplifiers, and all types of ac and dc
                 (independent and dependent) current and voltage
                 sources. Splice will perform branch current, nodal
                 voltage, Thevenin reduction, transfer function, and
                 two-port reduction analysis with options for component
                 substitutions (both numeric and\slash or symbolic
                 including zero and infinity), pole and zero
                 calculations, sinusoidal steady-state analysis, and
                 time domain result calculations. Potential classroom
                 applications of Splice 1.0, as well as future
                 enhancements of the software, are presented and

                 important from a design point of view. It has recently
                 been shown that in-plane vibration can play a major
                 role in the transmission of high frequency vibration
                 through a built-up structure, and any credible analysis
                 technique must take due account of the presence of
                 these vibrations. This paper provides a number of
                 results against which any analysis method for in-plane

                 is possible to realize the essential features of an
                 object oriented design. All considered linear electric
                 terminals are arranged in a class hierarchy using the
                 principle of multiple inheritance. The network
                 algorithm for setting up the equations is based on the
                 recursive graph searching method depth first. The
                 algorithm is extended by a special substructure
                 technique, in order to be able to calculate complex
                 networks with a higher number of network elements.
                 Finally, the feasibility of the proposed approach will
                 be demonstrated by two application examples.",

                 MATLAB-based, platform-independent, educational tool
                 which integrates numerical methods for solving problems
                 ranging from linear algebraic systems to partial
                 differential systems with a graphical user interface.
                 For modularity, the tool is divided into three blocks:
                 (1) a collection of numerical methods, which
                 constitutes the core of the package; (2) a series of
                 examples, problems, and figures, which contributes to
                 the understanding of the applicability of the numerical
                 techniques implemented in the package; and (3) a
                 graphics user interface, which integrates the methods
                 and examples into MATLAB's graphical environment. The
                 numerical methods range in complexity from elementary
                 applications to more complex examples representative of
                 engineering problems of interest. A help facility
                 assists the user with the program features. Sample
                 problems are presented to demonstrate the utility of
                 the program as an educational tool and as a vehicle for
                 introducing students to new numerical concepts and

  abstract =     "Full-text indexing of documents containing mathematics
                 cannot be considered a complete success unless the
                 mathematics symbolism is extracted and represented in a
                 standardized form permitting both searching for
                 formulas, and re-use of this information in (for
                 example) computer algebra systems. Most documents
                 produced in the past and subsequently digitally
                 encoded, and even most of those potentially ``born
                 digital'' in current journal production are---at
                 best---encoded in a printer form such as Adobe
                 Postscript [1], in which mathematics is not explicitly
                 marked or easily identifiable. While one might look
                 forward in the future to other document encodings such
                 as MathML, the common journal or textbook product is
                 essentially without semantic content: a jumble of odd
                 characters. Sometimes it is just a jumble of black and
                 white dots! In this paper we demonstrate an approach to
                 decoding, to recognizing and extracting mathematical
                 expressions, from a Postscript document. We can produce
                 a syntactic representation of the extracted expressions
                 which can then be used to generate various forms. For
                 example, if we extract TeX or Presentation MathML, we
                 can re-typeset the expression, but perhaps in a
                 different size or font family. More significantly, if
                 we start from this presentation information, we can
                 hope to combine it with additional contextual
                 processing of the surrounding text and meta-data
                 associated with the document, to assign semantics,(e.g.
                 content MathML), or provide versions in computer
                 algebra system languages such as Maple or Mathematica.
                 Finally, it is possible to use this material to present
                 audio or braille versions of mathematics for the
                 visually disabled. We have previously addressed some
                 aspects of the higher level of processing (parsing TeX
                 for example). In this paper we address the only first
                 stage and concentrate on what may seem to be overly
                 simple, but is in fact difficult to do precisely:
                 extracting the mathematics parts from text.",

  abstract =     "In designing parts of Runge--Kutta methods, order
                 conditions and truncation error coefficients (TECs) are
                 needed. Order conditions and TECs are typically
                 presented as a set of trees combined with rules for
                 producing algebraic expressions from the trees. The
                 tree sets are defined recursively and can be generated
                 by hand only for low orders. This article describes a
                 package of Matlab routines for automatically generating
                 Runge--Kutta trees, order conditions, and TECs. The
                 routines are capable of generating Maple code, Matlab
                 code, or \LaTeX{} expressions for ODEs or DAEs of index
                 1 and 2. In producing the package, two theoretical
                 problems are tackled: (a) avoiding the repeated
                 generation of the same tree and (b) the efficient
                 storage of TECs.",

                 evolution of dynamical systems. For simulations over
                 relatively short time spans, as compared to the
                 intrinsic time scales, standard (non-geometric)
                 integrators are often advantageous, as they include
                 adaptive and multistep methods, which can be both
                 accurate and fast. Extended computations require a
                 different, geometric approach, as non-geometric methods
                 tend to generate or dissipate energy artificially due
                 to the fact that they do not respect the fundamental
                 geometry of the phase flow, which means that at some
                 point the errors dominate. It is common to create
                 geometric numerical integrators based on either
                 previous knowledge of classes of non-geometric
                 numerical integrators, from which specific instances
                 can be derived that are geometric, or truncated series

                 This book presents a systematic and comprehensive
                 introduction to ordinary differential equations for
                 engineering students and practitioners. Mathematical
                 concepts and various techniques are presented in a
                 clear, logical, and concise manner. Various visual
                 features are used to highlight focus areas. Complete
                 illustrative diagrams are used to facilitate
                 mathematical modeling of application problems. Readers
                 are motivated by a focus on the relevance of
                 differential equations through their applications in
                 various engineering disciplines. Studies of various
                 types of differential equations are determined by
                 engineering applications. Theory and techniques for
                 solving differential equations are then applied to
                 solve practical engineering problems. Detailed
                 step-by-step analysis is presented to model the
                 engineering problems using differential equations from
                 physical principles and to solve the differential
                 equations using the easiest possible method. Such a
                 detailed, step-by-step approach, especially when
                 applied to practical engineering problems, helps the
                 readers to develop problem-solving skills",
