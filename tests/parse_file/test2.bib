Semantic annotation and ontologybased information extraction technologies form the cornerstone of such applications.

Furthermore, usability aspects need to be considered such as scalability, accessibility and interoperability. We outline the main requirements in terms of both usability and performance, proposing possible solutions and using examples of existing tools and resources.},

    area is under constant development, it requires improvement and
    standardisation. This paper discusses existing evaluation metrics, and
    proposes a new method for evaluating the ontology population task, which is
    general enough to be used in a variety of situations, yet more precise than
    many current metrics. The paper further describes our first efforts in
    operationalising the evaluation procedure, including the creation of a
    semantically annotated corpus that will function as a test bed for the
    proposed evaluation mechanism, and comparison of different evaluation
    metrics. We conclude that for ontology-based evaluation, a more complex
    mechanism than is traditionally used is preferable. This mechanism aims to
    drive a benchmarking assessment tool for the current state-of-the-art of
    ontology population, and to set a standard for best practice for future
    evaluation of human language technology for the semantic web.}

    financial and operational risk and other business intelligence applications
    such as company intelligence, by means of the XBRL standard. The results so

    specific goal of this work is to capture the evolution of metadata due to
    changed concepts, relations or metadata in one of the ontologies, and to
    capture changes to the ontology caused by changes to the metadata. After a
    short discussion of the nature of metadata, we propose a methodology to
    capture (1) the evolution of metadata induced by changes to the ontologies,
    and (2) the evolution of the ontology induced by changes to the underlying
    metadata. This will lead to the implementation of an approach for evolution

  abstract = {In recent years, following the rapid development in the Semantic
  Web and Knowledge Management research, ontologies have become more in demand
  in Natural Language Processing. An increasing number of systems use ontologies
  either internally, for modelling the domain of the application, or as data
  structures that hold the output resulting from the work of the system, in the
  form of knowledge bases. While there are many ontology editing tools aimed at
  expert users, there are very few which are accessible to users wishing to
  create simple structures without delving into the intricacies of knowledge
  representation languages. The approach described in this paper allows users to
  create and edit ontologies simply by using a restricted version of the English
  language. The controlled language described within is based on an open
  vocabulary and a restricted set of grammatical constructs. Sentences written
  in this language unambiguously map into a number of knowledge representation
  formats including OWL and RDF-S to allow round-trip ontology management}

  abstract = {Sumerian is a long-extinct language documented throughout the 
  ancient Middle East, arguably the first language for which we have written
  evidence, and is a language isolate (i.e. no related languages have so far 
  been identified). The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature (ETCSL), 
  based at the University of Oxford, aims to make accessible on the web over 350
  literary works composed during the late third and early second millennia BCE.
  The transliterations and translations can be searched, browsed and read online
  using the tools of the website. In this paper we describe the creation of 
  linguistic analysis and corpus search tools for Sumerian, as part of the 
  development of the ETCSL. This is designed to enable Sumerian scholars, 
  students and interested laymen to analyse the texts online and electronically,
  and to further knowledge about the language.}

        ABSTRACT = "         This article is W.'s response to Barwise and                            Perry's Situation         Semantics. W. suggests that B \& P, while  remaining          within the         realist tradition, have moved the  'semantic fulcrum'   by        accepting         a different view of what  constitute real things,   the        primitives         into which reality is  carved up, from the   Montagovians. B  \&       P         accept individuals,  relations and locations   as primitive,  and               do not require  possible worlds to figure in   their ontology.  While                acknowledging that their formal treatment   allows for more  elegant                handling of things like discourse   situations, etc. he  feels they            have     not addressed the real   problem, which for him  involves rejecting            the     realist assumption   that there is a reality  independent of            language use     for  language  to map onto. For W.  meaning is  determined           by use of      language  within a community, and  language  should be           viewed as  activity      rather than description. He   introduces 2 analaogies:            (1) economics      could suppose a value   function which maps each            object onto a real  value     and market   activity could then be viewed            as perturbations  to the  real     value  - W. suggests that a better            perspective is to  view value  as      determined by activities of buying            and selling (2)  relation of   roads  to    terrain - terrain conditions            road placement  but does  not   determine it   -  road placement is          more   fundamentally   determined by   prior human  needs   and wants         -  who needs   to go   where. W. suggests   situation  semantics may           be  useful for     describing increasingly more    sophisticated artificial            languages     (e.g. computer languages)  where   the assumptions it           makes  about a     neatly d
ivided world  existing   independently of         the   language   hold    true."

On-line news sources were mined for material reporting the same stories as those found in television broadcasts, and the text of these pages was semantically annotated using the KIM knowledge management platform. This resulted in more effective indexing than would have been possible if the programme transcript was indexed directly, owing to the poor quality of transcripts produced using automatic speech recognition. In addition, the
associations produced between web pages and television broadcasts enables the automatic creation of augmented interactive television broadcasts and multi-media websites.},

training set. This is particularly true when learning from smaller datasets which often have a few positive training examples and many negative ones. This paper takes two popular IE algorithms SVM and Perceptron and demonstrates how the introduction of an uneven margins parameter can improve the results on imbalanced training data in IE. Our experiments demonstrate that the uneven margin was indeed helpful, especially when learning from few examples. Essentially, the smaller the training set is, the more beneficial the uneven margin can be. We also compare our systems to other state-of-theart
algorithms on several benchmarking corpora for IE.},

The result consists of the matching texts in the corpus, displayed within the context of linguistic annotations (not just text, as is customary for KWIC systems). The data is displayed in a graphical user interface, which facilitates its exploration and the discovery of new patterns, which can in turn be tested by launching new ANNIC queries.},

  relation extraction, using features derived automatically from a number of
  GATE-based open-source language processing tools. In comparison to the
  previous works, we use several new features including part of speech tag,
  entity subtype, entity class, entity role, semantic representation of sentence
  and WordNet synonym set. The impact of the features on the performance is
  investigated, as is the impact of the relation classification hierarchy. The
  results show there is a trade-off among these factors for relation extraction
  and the features containing more information such as semantic ones can improve
  the performance of the ontological relation extraction task}

  abstract={Instance unification determines whether two instances in an ontology
  refer to the same object in the real world. More specifically, this paper
  addresses the instance unification problem for person names. The approach
  combines the use of citation information (i.e., abstract, initials, titles and
  co-authorship information) with web mining, in order to gather additional
  evidence for the instance unification algorithm. The method is evaluated on
  two datasets � one from the BT digital library and one used in previous work
  on name disambiguation. The results show that the information mined from the
  web contributes substantially towards the successful handling of highly
  ambiguous cases which lowered the performance of previous methods.}

 to make use of knowledge from the target ontology in order to improve semantic
 annotation results. However, very few approaches exploit the ontology structure
 itself, and those that do so, have some limitations. This paper introduces a
 hierarchical learning approach for IE, which uses the target ontology as an
 essential part of the extraction process, by taking into account the
 relations between concepts.  The approach is evaluated on the largest available
 seman-tically annotated corpus. The results demonstrate clearly the benefits of
 using knowledge from the ontology as input to the information extraction
 process. We also demonstrate the advantages of our approach over other
 state-of-the-art learning systems on a commonly used benchmark dataset}

 abstract = {Some classification problems, such as the NTCIR-06 F-term patent
 classification task, have general or specific relations between the target
 class labels. Consequently, in such cases, it is desirable that the relations
 among the labels can be taken into account in the evaluation measures. For
 example, if a system assigns an incorrect label to one instance and the
 assigned label has close relation with the true label, then the system may
 deserve some credit, rather than being given no credit at all as is the case
 with conventional evaluation measures. 
 
 In this paper we propose some new evaluation measures based on relations among
 classification labels, which can be seen as the label relation sensitive
 version of some important evaluation measures such as averaged precision and
 F-measure. We also present the results of applying the new evaluation measures
 to all submitted runs for the NTCIR-6 F-term patent classification task. The
 new measure did change the ranking positions of some runs (including the top
 runs in some cases) made by the conventional measure, while it kept the ranking
 position of many other runs}

 the best results according to two of the three measures  used for performance
 evaluation. Moreover, the results from some additional experiments demonstrate
 that our system has benefited from the SVM adaptations which we carried out. It
 also benefited from using the full patent text in addition to using the F-term
 description as extra training material. However, our results using an
 SVMvariant designed for hierarchical classification were much worse than those
 achieved with flat SVM classification. At the end of the paper we discuss the
 possible reasons for this, in the context of the F-term classification task}

 results using the NTCIR-6 English corpus for both training and testing are
 certainly among the first ones. Our results on the opinionated sentence
 recognition sub-task of the NTCIR-6 were encouraging. The results on the
 English evaluation of the NTCIR-6 opinion analysis task were obtained from the
 models learned from the MPQA corpus. The lower results on the NTCIR-6 opinion
 holder extraction subtask, in comparison with those using each corpus for both
 training and testing, may possibly show that there exist substantial
 differences between the MPQA corpus and the NTCIR-6 English corpus}

  solve software engineering related problems show promising results, the very
  basic process of augmenting software artifacts with their semantic
  representations is still an open issue. Indeed, exiting techniques to learn
  ontologies that describe the domain of a certain software project either 1)
  explore only one information source associated to this project or 2) employ
  supervised and domain specific techniques. In this paper we present an
  ontology learning approach that 1) exploits a range of information sources
  associated with software projects and 2) relies on techniques that are
  portable across application domains}

  aggregation of key pieces of knowledge from multiple sources in order to
  provide valuable information to customers or feed statistical BI models and
  tools. The massive amount of information available to business analysts makes
  information extraction and other natural language processing tools key
  enablers for the acquisition and use of that semantic information. We describe
  the application of ontology-based extraction and merging in the context of a
  practical e-business application for the EU MUSING Project where the goal is
  to gather international company intelligence and country/region information.
  The results of our experiments so far are very promising and we are now in the
  process of building a complete end-to-end solution},

  processing that language and manipulating an ontology. The input  sentences
  are analysed deterministically and compositionally with respect to a given
  ontology, which the software consults in order to interpret the input�s
  semantics; this allows the user to learn fewer syntactic structures since some
  of them can be used to refer to either classes or instances, for example. A
  repeated-measures, task-based evaluation has been carried out in comparison
  with a well-known ontology editor; our software received favourable results
  for basic tasks. The paper also discusses work in progress and future plans
  for developing this language and tool},

  abstract = {The semantic web represents a major advance in web utility, but it
	is currently difficult to create semantic-web content because pages
	must be semantically annotated through processes that are mostly
	manual and require a high degree of engineering skill. Furthermore,
	users need an effective way to query the semantic web, but any burden
	placed on users to learn a query language is unlikely to garner sufficient
	user support and interest. Unfortunately, both the creation and use
	of semantic-web pages are difficult, and these are precisely the
	processes that must be made simple in order for the semantic web
	to truly succeed. We propose using information-extraction ontologies
	to handle both of these challenges. In this paper we show how a successful
	ontology-based data-extraction technique can (1) automatically generate
	semantic annotations for ordinary web pages, and (2) support free-form,
	textual queries that will be relatively simple for end users to write.},

  abstract =	 {This paper reviews the recent developments in applying 
  geometric and quantum mechanics methods for information retrieval and natural 
  language processing. It discusses the interesting analogies between components 
  of information retrieval and quantum mechanics. It then describes some quantum 
  mechanics phenomena found in the conventional data analysis and in the 
  psychological experiments for word association. It also presents the 
  applications of the concepts and methods in quantum mechanics such as quantum 
  logic and tensor product to document retrieval and meaning of composite words, 
  respectively. The purpose of the paper is to give the state of the art on and
  to draw attention of the IR community to the geometric and quantum methods and
  their potential applications in IR and NLP}

In the emerging Semantic Web, search, interpretation and aggregation can be addressed by ontology-based semantic mark-up. In this paper, we examine semantic annotation, identify a number of requirements, and review the current generation of semantic annotation systems. This analysis shows that, while there is still some way to go before semantic annotation tools will be able to address fully all the knowledge management needs, research in the area is active and making good progress.},
